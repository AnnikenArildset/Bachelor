\section{Security of the pipeline}
Security of the pipeline in short terms are the security measures that are taken into consideration when securing the pipeline itself. This includes not only securing the pipeline istelf, but also the infrastrucutre, components, network that are used to process the code that goes through the pipeline. Securing of the pipeline ensures that the code is not tampered through during the process of going through the pipeline. 


\subsection{Branch Protection}

\subsubsection{Require a pull request before merging}
Administrators of the repository can add rules to the repository which restricts pull requests to have a specific number of people approving the changes before merging to a protected branch. Administrators can allow users with written permissions to do the approving as well as users considered to be code owners. \cite{ProtectedBranches}

It is under this type of protection the "four eyes" principal is applied. Since this type of protection require that at least two people approve the merge, this includes the person itself doing the changes, this principal is a controlling mechanism that increases the security measures.

\subsubsection{Require status checks to pass before merging}
When users work together in the same repository, it is important to maintain high quality of the code that's being pushed and merged. Enabling "require status checks to pass before merging" allow the administrators of the repository to set certain criteria that needs to be fulfilled before the code is merged. These criteria's are called "status checks", and such checks can run automatically on the code before its merged. Status checks can for example be that the code is checked for style violations or different tests can also be run. \cite{ProtectedBranches}

\subsubsection{Require conversation resolution before merging}
Working together with other team members in the same Github repository can quickly become chaotic, therefore it is important to have clear communication and collaboration. A way to secure this is to enable "require conversation resolution before merging". This allows all discussions to be properly resolved before any merging happens. This is a setting that if there are any discussions regarding a pull request, these discussions need to be resolved before its merged. This means that any issues, discussions or comments needs to be resolved for the merge to be successful.

\subsubsection{Require signed commits}
Enabling "require signed commits" can be considered a security measure that secures that changes in the code have not been tampered with. 

To be able to have secured signed commits, all commits pushed to the repository must be signed with a \acrlong{gpg} key. A \acrshort{gpg} key is  a unique digital signature that in short terms verifies the person that is committing to the repository is who they say they are. 
Such restrictions minimizes the risk of unauthorized users to do changes in the repository, since there are only trusted users that sign with \acrshort{gpg} keys that are allowed to do changes. 

\subsubsection{Require linear history}
When enabling this security feature, it ensures that all changes done in the repository are done in a specific order, one after another without creating any branches or forks. This will as a result make it easier to keep track of all the changes that has been done and minimizes the chances of mistakes. 

This means that when enforcing such measure, it restricts the possibility for users to merge their own changes with the main branch. This means that all changes needs to be put on top of the main branch, so that all changes can easily be traced back to main branch without making a mess of different branches. 

\subsubsection{Require deployments to succeed before merging}



\subsubsection{Lock branch}

\subsubsection{Do not allow bypassing the above settings}
