\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background} %Hvorfor vi fikk oppgaven 
\acrlong{nbim}, from now on referred to as \acrshort{nbim}, is a division within the central bank responsible for overseeing the Government Pension Fund of Norway, which has a worth of 13,000 billion Norwegian kroner \cite{nbimwebsite}. Due to its large value, the fund is a major target for potential malicious actors. It faces an average of three severe cyber attacks per day, totaling around 100,000 attacks each year. Out of these, more than 1,000 are considered significant threats \cite{nbimattacks}. Therefore, it is crucial for \acrshort{nbim}, as well as other organizations, to ensure the security of their systems and applications before deploying them into their cloud services. 

\acrlong{sdlc} (\acrshort{sdlc}), describes how software applications are built - from planning through implementation and running in production. It also includes ensuring security at the different stages of software development. In order to accommodate frequent deployments to production, it is important to automate the security testing by building it into the deployment pipeline. Security testing can further benefit from shift-left, where testing is done as early as possible in the pipeline. Implementing a strong and secure software development life cycle is essential to prevent attacks from hackers and other malicious actors on your application. Securing the \acrshort{sdlc} is a large and actively developed area with a lot of interest from the industry. Demonstrating the integration and practical application of various tools and methods can be beneficial for both \acrshort{nbim} and other organizations.

\subsection{Problem Area}
Society is constantly developing, and traditional security approaches are no longer sufficient. Securing the \acrlong{sdlc} has become a common topic in the tech industry, and there are a lot of resources available to help organizations implement best practices and effective security measures. Finding the appropriate resources can take time, and automating the complete distribution process, along with automated testing using multiple tools, can be a time-consuming process. NBIM is looking for proof of concepts on how to build a secure pipeline using best practices, as well as implement multiple tools which can scan for security misconfiguration and vulnerabilities at key stages of the pipeline. 

 
\section{Scope Limitations}
The thesis will cover all phases of the \acrlong{sdlc} and give an overview of each of the phases and the importance of securing them.  However, due to the scope, only the last four phases will be the main priority. 
The group has also decided not to delve deeply into \gls{shift-left} testing within the life cycle, as the focus is on the later phases. Nevertheless, the group is well-informed about the concept and understands the importance of such testing. 


\section{Target Group}
The thesis has multiple target groups. The primary target group is NBIM, their stakeholder for this thesis, for whom the group will produce a comprehensive report on the task assigned to them. This report has the potential to benefit other organizations, and therefore, another target group is any organization that utilizes the SDLC and aims to improve its security.

\section{Goals}
\subsection{Performance goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The group will have good communication and always keep each other informed on what has been done and what is currently being worked on. 
    \item The group will work efficiently when working on the thesis. 
    \item The group our motivated to achieve the a good result and will work accordingly. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Result goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The stakeholder start using the setup that the group has come up with. 
    \item Give the stakeholder an overview of tools that can be used for security checks, which can make the process more automated and efficient. 
    \item Provide a comprehensive analysis of how a secure pipeline can be built from GitHub to AWS. 
    \item Offer new insights and perspectives on the topic, which can increase the stakeholder's awareness of the different topic areas. 
\end{itemize}

  

\section{The Group’s Academic Background}
The project group is currently in the third and final year of a Bachelor's degree program in Digital Infrastructure and Cyber Security at NTNU, campus Gjøvik. Throughout the studies, the group has covered a diverse range of subjects such as risk management, ethical hacking, cybersecurity, and teamwork. These subjects have equipped the group with relevant knowledge for their thesis work.

\subsection{Knowledge that had to be acquired}
\label{section: Knowledge that had to be acquired}
The group had to acquire various new aspects of software development for the thesis, as it was not extensively covered in their studies. This included topics like \acrshort{sdlc}, \acrlong{sast}, \acrlong{dast} and \acrlong{sca}, and more. Due to the inclusion of the practical parts in the thesis, like testing insecure code, the group had to learn about building a pipeline and integrating various security tools to ensure a secure development. As a significant part of the main scope focused on tools integrated in GitHub and Amazon Web Services, the group had to acquaint themselves with these tools, and the various features of GitHub. Despite the group's previous experience with GitHub from previous courses, there were still numerous features that were unfamiliar to them. In contrast, AWS was entirely unfamiliar to the group, and they had no prior knowledge about it. However, they had used similar cloud services like Microsoft Azure.

In addition, the group had to familiarize themselves with Terraform, which was utilized to establish the automated pipeline. The decision to use Terraform instead of working solely in the GUI was based on several reasons to use infrastructure-as-code over manual configuration. For instance, automation could enhance efficiency and decrease errors in the development process.

\section{Framework}

\subsection{Timeframe}
The group has a period from the 11th of January 2023 to the 22nd of May 2023 to finish the task. However, the group decided early on that the first draft would be delivered 3rd of April, which would give the supervisor some time to read properly through and give feedback. 

\subsection{Other}
The stakeholder was quite limited when it came to access to their systems and how to define the scope. The stakeholder was mostly interested in this being a general report that was not specified for their systems. Since the stakeholder did not grant the group access to their systems or development environment, the group had a lot of leeway in terms of what we wanted to specify or limit in the thesis. 


\section{Methodology}
The group utilized a structured methodology that helped complete the project more efficiently. The group divided the work into four phases, where the first phase was mostly focused on understanding and getting a better understanding of different topics like SDLC, DAST, SAST, and SCA. In the second phase, the group spent time on research and locating relevant documentation that was used in the report. In the third phase, the group began working on the report and building the necessary pipelines that were requested. Finally, in the fourth phase, the group tested the different pipelines and the other practical elements created and did changes based on feedback given. The group also evaluated the report as a whole, ensuring that it was comprehensive and met all the requirements that were set. This way of working allowed the group to complete the project in a timely manner. 

\subsection{Research methods}
The group used different methods to gain knowledge that was needed to fulfill the requirements that were given. Below some of the research methods are mentioned. 

\subsubsection{Interviews/meetings}
During the second phase of the project, the group had interviews with different lecturers at NTNU Gjøvik for gathering information about the related topics. By exploring the perspectives of experts within software security, the group gained knowledge about the topic from another perspective than the ones given during the literature studies. Questions that the group had were written down in advance so that the group could ask about different topics that were unclear from the research that was done in advance.   

\subsubsection{Literature study}
The literature study was done by researching online for relevant information about the topics. The group also used ChatGPT as a guide. It was used to give relevant web pages for each of the topics. The literature study helped the group with adding suitable material for the theory chapter. It also helped the group with gaining more knowledge on the topics since this was something that was not familiar to the group.
