Here are some notes:

The group are considering testing one SAST tool, one DAST tool and one SCA tool. 
If we see we have the time, we will test a IAST tool as well, which is a combination of SAST and DAST. 

When testing, we are considering doing one test were we test  open-soruce code of an application that is widely used, for example Brave browser. We then run another test were we have our own code that clearly has vulnerabilities and lastly test code that does not have clearly vulnerabilities for the eye to see. We will then compare these.
