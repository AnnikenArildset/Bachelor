\section{Introduction}
This chapter contains reflections of the work that has been done, what can be done in the future that can strengthen the thesis

\section{Reflection}


\section{Evaluation of the Work Process}



\section{Further Work}

In further work, it could strengthen the thesis to perform a broader analysis of various security tools that perform SAST, DAST and SCA scans -  where the selected tools are based on these analyses. During these analyses, an assessment can also be made of which requirements must be met in order for a tool to be selected. 

To get an understanding of the whole \acrlong{sdlc}, it would have relevant to add earlier phases into the thesis to acquire a more complete view of the life cycle and correspond with the shift-left method that prioritizes early testing to detect vulnerabilities sooner. This would demonstrate the shift-left concept, which involves conducting testing as early as feasible in the process.
