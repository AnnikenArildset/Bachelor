\chapter{Pipeline security}
\section{Introduction}
Pipeline security can be considered to be a large part of the process of securing software development, from its source code to production deployment. The group has categorized pipeline security into two aspects - security in the pipeline and security of the pipeline. In many ways implementing both security in the pipeline and of the pipeline will increase the overall security of the pipeline. Below the group will look closer into what are important security measures within these two.

Below is a figure of a \gls{Pipeline} without any security measures implemented. As the different measures are presented in the following chapter, they will be added to the pipeline. In the end, this will result in a complete, secure pipeline.
