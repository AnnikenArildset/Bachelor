\label{Pipeline security}
\section{Introduction}
Pipeline security can be considered to be a large part of the process of securing software development, from its source code to production deployment. Pipeline security is categorized into two aspects - security in the pipeline and security of the pipeline \cite{inofpipeline}. In many ways implementing both security in the pipeline and of the pipeline will increase the overall security of the pipeline. Further, the group will look closer into what are important security measures within these two.

Figure \ref{fig: Pipeline without any security measures} displays a \gls{pipeline} without any security measures implemented. The initial four stages in the pipeline are considered the implementation phase in the \acrshort{sdlc}. Further, the security testing stage in the pipeline is considered the testing phase, the deployment stage is the deployment phase, and so on. As the different measures are presented in the following chapter, they will be added to the pipeline. In the end, this will result in a complete, secure pipeline.
