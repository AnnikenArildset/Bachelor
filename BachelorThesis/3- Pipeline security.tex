\chapter{Pipeline security}
\label{Pipeline security}
\section{Introduction}
\gls{pipeline} security is a large part of securing software development, from source code to production deployment. Pipeline security is categorized into two aspects - security in the \gls{pipeline} and security of the \gls{pipeline} \cite{inofpipeline}. In many ways implementing both security in the \gls{pipeline} and of the  \gls{pipeline}  will increase the overall security. Further, the group looks closer into essential security measures within these two. 
\\~\\
Figure \ref{fig: Pipeline without any security measures} displays a \gls{pipeline} without any security measures implemented. The initial four stages in the pipeline are considered the implementation phase in the \acrshort{sdlc}. Furthermore, the security testing stage in the pipeline is considered the testing phase, the deployment stage is the deployment phase, and so on. The following chapter presents the different measures that is added to the pipeline. In the end, a complete and secure pipeline is achieved.
