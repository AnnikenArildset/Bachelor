\chapter{Pipeline security}
\label{Pipeline security}
\section{Introduction}
Pipeline security is a large part of securing software development, from source code to production deployment. Pipeline security is categorized into two aspects - security in the pipeline and security of the pipeline \cite{inofpipeline}. In many ways implementing both security in the pipeline and of the pipeline will increase the overall security of the pipeline. Further, the group will look closer into essential security measures within these two. 
\\~\\
Figure \ref{fig: Pipeline without any security measures} displays a \gls{pipeline} without any security measures implemented. The initial four stages in the pipeline are considered the implementation phase in the \acrshort{sdlc}. Furthermore, the security testing stage in the pipeline is considered the testing phase, the deployment stage is the deployment phase, and so on. The following chapter will present the different measures that will be added to the pipeline. In the end, a complete and secure pipeline will be achieved.
