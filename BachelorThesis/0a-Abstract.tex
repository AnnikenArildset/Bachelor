Abstract: \> \> Many security measures can be integrated into the process as soon as\\ \> \> the  code is uploaded to GitHub, and there are multiple scans that can\\ \> \> be performed during the transition from GitHub to the cloud\\ \> \> environment to ensure that the security is maximized before deploying\\ \> \>  the application to the cloud. The group has built an automated pipeline \\ \> \>and added tools.
