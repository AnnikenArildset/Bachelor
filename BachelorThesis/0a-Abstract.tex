Abstract: \> \> Many security measures can be integrated into the process as soon as the \\ \> \> code is uploaded to GitHub, and  there are multiple scans that can be\\ \> \> performed during the transition from GitHub to the cloud environment to\\ \> \> ensure that the security is maximized before deploying the application to \\ \> \>the cloud. The group have built an automated pipeline and added tools\\ \> \>and measures that is considered best practice in the industry. The tools\\ \> \> were chosen based on ease of use and previous documentation of similar\\ \> \> testing.
