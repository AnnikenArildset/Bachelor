Abstract: 
\>\>This research aims to address the importance of securing systems and \\ \> \>applications by focusing on implementing security testing and integrating\\ \> \>  tools into a development pipeline. The report provides a proof of concept\\ \> \> for building a secure pipeline, emphasizing best practices and security\\ \> \> tools to detect vulnerabilities early in the Software Development Life\\ \> \> Cycle (SDLC). The findings and recommendations can contribute to the\\ \> \> industry's understanding of securing the SDLC and mitigating threats.
