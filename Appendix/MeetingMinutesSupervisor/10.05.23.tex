\textbf{\underline{Discussion about the thesis}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Went through some of the comments Filip had made in the final draft
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Change some of the checkmarks in the Table \ref{fig: Comparison of SCA, DAST, and SASt} to be something else - looks like it is positive, but it is not
            \item Mention of AWS and GitHub in security of the pipeline, but it is not supposed to mention any tools? We mention it because AWS and GitHub are what is \say{required} of us to use and is presented as that earlier
            \item Some of the footnotes need rephrasing
        \end{itemize}
    \item When using a source for the whole paragraph, should we include it at the end of the first sentence or at the end of the last? Do whatever we want, just be consistent. 
    \item What code should we include in the appendix? The main code could be in the appendix, smaller parts are in the repository. See what other theses have done before
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\underline{Discussion about the thesis}}
