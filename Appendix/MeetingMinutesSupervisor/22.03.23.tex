\textbf{\underline{Discussion about the thesis}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Good idea to implement practical work - like how we have built a secure pipeline
    \item Things are a bit all over the place now - it will come together eventually
    \item We should describe the work pipeline
    \item Some sections are going to be removed - like Testing
    \item Should include a link to our GitHub - the most important parts should be included as an appendix
    \item We should write about maintenance security
\end{itemize}
