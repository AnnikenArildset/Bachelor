\textbf{\underline{Discussion about the thesis}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We have a working practical prototype - we will add it to the deployment chapter soon 
    \item In the deployment chapter we will add models and explanations of what happens through the pipeline – make it understandable 
    \item For the presentation – maybe record the process and speed it up to demonstrate 
    \item Thinking of connecting our own work to the practices we recommend and SDLC etc 
    \item Included frameworks – good idea, will read through and give us feedback on where it should be 
    \item Implement frameworks to our own work 
    \item Footnotes are ugly, can't fix it so it's fine
    \item Write a subsection on why we chose integrated GitHub tools and AWS services 
    \item Pros and cons for AWS services – add it for the different services, based mostly on our own opinions, and try to find sources as well 
    \item
