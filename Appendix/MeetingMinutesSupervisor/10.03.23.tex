\textbf{\underline{Discussion about the thesis}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Group is doing well – have done a lot of work and is pleased with the result so far 
    \item Looked through some of the comments made in the thesis to clear up some confusion
    \item Group wondered if it was ok to use blog posts as sources 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item That’s ok if the source is reliable 
        \end{itemize}
    \item Discussed how to do citing in the thesis – group is used to “[..]”, but we should look into that further
    \item Could look at including footnotes for websites to tools we write about, e.g. Snyk 
    \item For the practical part of the project: group thought of making a use case of a pipeline with implemented security tools, and works on automation of pipelines with Terraform code 
    \item When using CodeQL – show examples of critical, high, medium and low level alerts 
    \item Could be beneficial to look at another SAST tool (either from GitHub or a third party) 
\end{itemize}
