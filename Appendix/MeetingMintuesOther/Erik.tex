\textbf{\underline{Discussion about what to do for the thesis}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Group is feeling a little lost what to do and where to go on with the report - hoping Erik had some input on what to include and what to focus on
    \item The group should ask the stakeholder what exactly they imagine getting tested 
    \item Should maybe test large open source projects 
    \item Should look into GitHub and AWS tools 
    \item For the thesis, a suggestion is to go in depth on the tools GitHub and AWS offers, make a secure pipeline, rather than comparing tools - these tools are already state of the art 
    \item Should start by making some models showing the flow of development, visualizing all steps 
    \item Start by coding $->$ docker containers $->$ etc. 
    \item Should look into usinex SDLC Security report, and other reports from usinex (quality assured) 
    \item Look into what Microsoft says about best practice in securing the SDLC 
\end{itemize}
