\textbf{\underline{Discussion on how to test code}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We should look at high level code and low-level code, because they have different type of security flaws we can test
    \item We got recommended to look at different vulnerabilities databases and look at the code that is attached to some of the vulnerabilities
    \item Not recommended to test PHP code
    \item We should use longer code bits because that is a more realistic test
    \item Useful links:
