\textbf{\underline{Discussion about the thesis}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Look more into DAST tools – so far, we have no specific
    \item DDoS protection 
    \item We have looked more at signatures – AWS artifact signing
        \begin{itemize}
            \item KMS cryptography 
            \item Need to configure ourselves (?)
        \end{itemize}
    \item Lambda – supports signings in bundles, not docker image
    \item Compare GPG vs SSH keys for signing - Security vs user friendliness
    \item Find a paper with test case of eg juice-shop to compare tools
    \item Start with test case soon – try the whole pipeline
    \item Look more into CodeQL in VScode
    \item Could look at push protection – might not be so user friendly?
    \item Can use their colour palette but not their logo
\end{itemize}
