\textbf{\underline{Discussion about the thesis}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Find a way to sign the artifacts in S3 buckets - AWS CodeArtifact (artifact management)
    \item Figure out where to sign - need to look closer into what CodeDeploy actually does
    \item Trying to automate CodeQL, Dependabot, and secret scanner
    \item Would be nice to automate everything (end-to-end)
    \item On track for the final draft to be finished - we are focusing on getting as much text in as possible for the delivery
    \item They think the structure looks good so far
    \item Figures look better and more explanatory than before
    \item We are going to add the steps from the pipeline into the phases of the SDLC
    \item Sent them out GitHub repository for the Terraform code
    \item Could be better to use Lambda instead of EC2 - less complicated
    \item Nice with a screenshot of security alerts and a little explanation 
    \item Could look into how many alerts for CodeQL vs the amount of known vulnerabilities - check juice-shop and other code
\end{itemize}
