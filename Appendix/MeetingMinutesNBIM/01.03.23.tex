\textbf{\underline{Discussion about the thesis}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Build upon earlier bachelor theses 
    \item Scrap IAST and RAST
    \item We can get SAST and SCA scans from GitHub
    \item Look at GitHub Actions
    \item One cannot set up checks for signes code in AWS, but one can set up a point in the pipeline
    \item Look into juice-shop (git repo)
    \item Dependabot does not support all languages, but should not be any less good than others
    \item Look at other papers about tools and base it on this. There is a lot of similar papers out there
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\underline{Practical}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Get an end to end as fast as possible (Secret Scanning, Dependabot)
    \item Add scanning tools from AWS (container scanning)
    \item Implement CodeQL and SCA when we get the pipeline to work
    \item Nice to use what GitHub already offers to get GitHub Actions to run
    \item Set branch protection – look into this
    \item GPG keys in GitHub – look into this
    
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\underline{Other}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We will send them updated sprint plan
    \item Set up weekly meetings
\end{itemize}
