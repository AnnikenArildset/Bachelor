\textbf{\underline{Discussion about the thesis}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is it necessary to include the work process? 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Have seen from previous groups that it is normal to discuss the process
        \end{itemize}
    \item Should get the overall picture to come better together
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Why things fit together
            \item What is important to focus on 
        \end{itemize}
    \item Should highlight the most important points at the end of the paragraphs
    \item For the figures - should be able to understand the figure without having read the text
    \item Other than this, the report is coming together well
    \item We are struggling a bit with the deployment chapter
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Don't know how advanced it should be - the level of knowledge the reader has
            \item Have gotten conflicting messages from the supervisor from NTNU and NBIM - one says it should be detailed, but the other says it should be a brief explanation
        \end{itemize}
    \item Should consider excluding open source as a pro/con - we say it is a bad thing, but Stian has a more positive view on open source. Maybe better to not mention it?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\underline{Other}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item They will try to read through the whole report before the weekend
    \item We can set up more meetings if needed now that the deadline is approaching
\end{itemize}
