\textbf{\underline{Discussion about the thesis}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unsure how to implement code in the thesis - talk to supervisor about it
    \item Code as appendix - write about it without necessarily showing it
    \item Consider if we should build the text with focus on first time users or for more advanced users. 
    \item One angle might be if there is too much implementation, or some is more difficult to integrate, we could make a table where we rank based on user friendliness. 
    \item Could look at the amount of notifications you receive - not so good if you get spammed with notifications 
    \item Talking about security in deployment - separate between deployment to testing and deployment to production
    \item Security after deployment - becomes maintenance (maintain the security). Can use different tools in AWS, like protect incoming traffic, monitoring etc. This is a lot of work, but can be mentioned
    \item Important to check what we want to deploy is what has been deployed
\end{itemize}
