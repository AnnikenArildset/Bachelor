\textbf{\underline{Practical work in the thesis}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write about the complexity of the work rather then a step-by-step user guide
    \item Maybe include terraform code for security in Git
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\underline{Analysis of tools}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Point to other's analysis of tools rather then doing it ourselves
    \item Might only end up with maximum of two tools each step - so might not be that important to include
    \item Possible to discuss in the discussion chapter
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\underline{Basic security}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can briefly include basic security - such as access control and MFA
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\underline{Other}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stian will look at GPG vs SSH keys - we read GPG was better, but he had heard otherwise
\end{itemize}
